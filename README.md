# Cross-Forest project - Pilot CAMBrIc
This repository has been build to develop and store the simulations developed in the framework of 
Cross-Forest project 
![Fig1](https://github.com/simanfor-dask/CrossForest-simulations/logos/logo_CFt.png)
funded by CEF program.

## CrossForest-simulations
simulations performed at Cal√©ndula HPC - scripts and notes

## Simulations with randomly generated plots
All plots has been randomly generated with an R script `PlotsGenerator.R` in which number of trees per plot, number of plots per file and average dimension of trees is predefined.

There are a set of 10 simulations, from sim001 to sim010, with a raising number of total plots.

## Simulations with NFI plots

After testing HPC and SIMANFOR performance, we run simulations with all possible plots from Spanish NFI with 5 different scenarios
